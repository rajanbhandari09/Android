Android Projects

1. Project 1
- The project demonstrates the use of implicit intents to start another activity based on action specified in intent
- User enters a string containing a combination of characters and numbers and presses the button
- The activity detects if the entered string contains number in format “(xxx) yyy-zzzz” or “(xxx)yyy-zzzz” and then creates an intent with action as send message and start an activity
- If the entered string does not contain a number in the above format, no action is performed

2. Project 2
- The project demonstrates the custom implementation of adapter in Android and use of context menus
- A view is constructed from a list of song titles, artist/band names & album images using a custom adapter and then passed on to ListView for display in an activity
- Clicking an item in the list navigates a user to the youtube page of the song
- Long press click of an item in listview displays a context menu with options to navigate to youtube or wikipedia page of the song
